# Movie Recommendation System
## üìä Dataset
This project uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset available on Kaggle. It contains data on over 5,000 movies, including plot summaries, cast, crew, budget, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The recommendation engine is built using the following pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning & Merging:** The initial movie and credit datasets are loaded and merged. Irrelevant columns are dropped and missing values are handled.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Key information like genres, keywords, cast (top 5 actors), and the director are extracted from the raw text data.

3. **Feature Engineering:** The extracted features and the plot overview are combined into a single "tags" string for each movie. This string acts as the unique profile for each film.

4. **Stemming:** Each word in the "tags" is reduced to its root form (e.g., "loving" becomes "love") using NLTK's PorterStemmer.

5. **Text Vectorization using BoW:** Each movie's "tags" string is converted into a numerical vector using CountVectorizer (5000 features). This creates a vector space where each movie has a unique position.

6. **Cosine Similarity:** The cosine similarity is calculated between all movie vectors. The resulting score (from 0 to 1) represents how similar the movies are. A score closer to 1 indicates a higher similarity.

7. **Recommendation:** When you input a movie, the system finds its vector and returns the movies with the highest similarity scores.
